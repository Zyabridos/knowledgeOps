Game Print Hub is a personal full-stack engineering playground created partly for fun and partly to help me grow as an engineer.

It's where I experiment with frontend, backend, infrastructure, DevOps, 3D printing workflows, and everything in between.

Although the platform is deployed and continuously evolving, it is far from being a finished or polished product.
Many features are incomplete, some routes break, and parts of the system may change drastically from one week to another.
This is fine by me — Game Print Hub is a long-term learning project, not a commercial service.

Over time, as I refine both the codebase and the architecture, I hope the site will grow into a fully working, stable environment that reflects my progress as an engineer.
